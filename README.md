## Description:
To-do.

## Developer's notes:
Okay, so I'm always experimenting & trying new things.
You've seen my self updatable E2 scripts & what not, where new stuff gets updated automatically, but ya gotta manually reload the E2 chip itself, right?
I've decided to stop working on that project & start out fresh - mainly because I've found a better way of doing it, & I want to see if this new way will work.
My original vision with that project was, I was going to integrate that code into all of my Garry's Mod Train Build projects, among a few other E2 projects as well. The reason why I haven't done that yet, is well... let's face it, I burned myself out on coding, altogether; & whenever I look at all my old projects (Including my Remote ID project), my eyes just glaze over & I find myself staring at my screen for four hours (forcing myself to try to carry on with said project), instead of doing something productive.
As irony would have it, that's also counter-productive.

Before I carry on any further, I want to state that at this time, I don't intend to pick up where I left off with my old projects.
I feel like it's better for me to let that go, & move to greener pastures.

Now, for the good news...
I have a couple of new projects up on the board & this repo is one of them. I may-or-may-not start whittling my way through this right now. But, for the most part, I have some new projects coming up in 2022 - watch this space.

I now work with Visual Studio Code.
I've started working with Visual Studio Code, since the beginning of 2021; & the more I work with this amazing development environment, the more I'm becoming familiar with it & (by extension) the better I am at coding.
I've also started using Visual Studio Code to develop all my Arduino-based projects as well, & I have recently discovered that I can hook VS Code up to GitHub. Pretty skookum, huh.

Before I figured out VS Code, I used to use GitHub Atom to manage my repositories, which served its purpose well, at the time.
But, I find it better for myself to have access to everything in one program. This also means things like the Arduino IDE (which I also used to develop my Arduno-based projects on) are also kinda obsolete to me. Now, the only reason why I still need to hang onto the Arduino IDE is because one of the plugins for Visual Studio Code still needs to go through the Arduino IDE, in order for me to do what I do.

But, all in all, things are starting to look up, for me; & I got some new stuff in the works, starting from 2022.
I hope you're all doing well out there, considering the circumstances. =^/.^=
